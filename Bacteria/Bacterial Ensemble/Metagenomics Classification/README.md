# Bacterial Metagenomics Classification

These notebooks detail training taxonomic classification models based on simulated sequencing data. The data used comes from the paper 
[Deep learning models for bacteria taxonomic classification of metagenomic data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6069770/) by 
Fiannaca et al. The dataset is available at [this repo](https://github.com/IcarPA-TBlab/MetagenomicDC).

The dataset is composed of simulated sequencing data from the 16S hypervariable region of 100 bacterial species. There are two simulated 
datasets - one for amplicon sequencing and one for shotgun short-read sequencing. For more information on construction of the dataset, see 
the linked repo.
