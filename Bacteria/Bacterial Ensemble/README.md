# Bacterial Ensemble Notebooks

These notebooks detail preparing genomic data from multiple bacterial organisms, then training a genomic language model on that data. 
__Bacterial Ensemble 0__ details what organisms are used as sources for genetic information and how that genetic information is stored. 
__Bacterial Ensemble 1__ details training the genomic language model. The language model is used as the basis for an E. coli promoter 
classification model, detailed in the [E. coli 3 Bacterial Ensemble Pretraining](https://github.com/kheyer/Genomic-ULMFiT/blob/master/Bacteria/E.%20Coli/E.%20coli%203%20Bacterial%20Ensemble%20Pretraining.ipynb) 
notebook.
