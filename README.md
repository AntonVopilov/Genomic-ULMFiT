# Genomic ULMFiT

This repo details the application of [ULMFiT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) to genomics classification problems. The method proves easy
 to train and produces competitive results. The method leverages unsupervised training on large, unlabeled, genomic data to develop an accurate
 classifier from a small number of examples. This is advantageous given the large amount of unlabeled genetic data floating around.
  
More to come (both in terms of applications and organisms) as my GPU capability permits.
