# Human lncRNA Classification

These notebooks look at training a classification model to distinguish between human coding mRNA sequences and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) 
sequences following the Genomic ULMFiT approach. This dataset comes from the paper 
[A deep recurrent neural network discovers complex biological rules to decipher RNA protein-coding potential](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6144860/) 
by Hill et al. and is available for download [here](https://osf.io/4htpy/).
